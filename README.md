# meeLib

Library of Houdini HDAs filled with Python 3 scripting to answer specific issues

## Features

- :floppy_disk: **Convert your VDB to AUR File format for V-Ray without a Licence**
- :hammer: **More to come...**

## Support

- This is **Indie** licence locked 
- This library works with **Houdini 19.x** or higher and **Python 3.7.x** or higher
#### For "VDB to AUR" node:
- You need **PhoenixFD 2023** or higher (any DCC will work) [Chaos Group PhoenixFD](https://www.chaos.com/phoenix)
- HDA only works with **Windows** (since PhoenixFD is Windows only)
- You don't need a V-Ray or PhoenixFD **licence** to use this tool. A node exists with V-Ray for Houdini but it requires V-Ray and a Licence
- This tool use the "cache-converter.exe" bin inside the PhoenixFD folder

## Installation

Just like any Houdini package library :
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `meeLib.json` file to the package folder of your Houdini User Directory `houdini19.x/packages`
3. From here, you have 2 options :
    1. Copy the whole meeLib archive in your package folder
    2. Edit `MEELIB` path of the `meeLib.json` to the meeLib folder prefered location

If you are lost, don't worry! [MOVFX](https://www.youtube.com/@_movfx) made a tutorial about the installation of the awesome [qLib](https://github.com/qLab/qLib).
This is the same process. You can find the video right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wse67BAD7ys)

## Notes

Everything is free of charge and use, commercial whatever.. Just don't sell it, that's wierd
This is just the start, expect more to come in the near future :smiley:
Also, "mee" from meeLib is pronounced [m…õ] like the firce syllable of 'Metal' :angel:
